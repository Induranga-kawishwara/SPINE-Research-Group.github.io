**Stanford Students**. We're always looking for Stanford students who are interested in becoming involved with research! We have a variety of projects that range from system and model building to data analysis and user research. We expect undergraduate and M.S. students working with the lab to commit a minimum of 8 hours of time to research every week as well as to attend weekly full lab meetings.
We typically require that students have taken the introductory course in the topic area that they want to work in (e.g., CS144: Introduction to Computer Networking, CS155: Computer and Network Security, CS 152: Trust and Safety Engineering, or CS229: Machine Learning). Please reach out to Zakir Durumeric or Liz Izhikevich to become involved. You can also browse some of our current projects on CURIS.

**External Students.** We do not currently have research opportunities for students outside of Stanford University, nor do we have influence over admission into Stanford programs.
