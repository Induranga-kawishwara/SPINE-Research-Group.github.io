RMIT's student-led rocket team have continued their legacy of success at the Australian Universities Rocket Competition (AURC), placing second overall and winning the Technical Excellence Award for their design.

The Australian Universities Rocket Competition is organised by the Australian Youth Aerospace Association (AYAA) and its event stakeholders such as the Department of Defence. 

The annual competition requires university teams to design, build and launch a high-powered scientific rocket to a target height of 5,000ft or 10,000ft. 

This year the RMIT team, who call themselves HIVE, designed and built a rocket to fly a 2kg cube satellite to an exact altitude of 10,000ft – which is about 3km into the atmosphere – and land the rocket safely so that it could be launched again without major repairs.
